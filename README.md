### This repository has slides for my presentation at Northeast Bioimaging Analysis Meeting, Oct 20 2023, hosted by JAX in Farmington, CT.

## Contributing to the napari community: widgets, plugins, napari core, documentation—oh my!

Peter Sobolewski & napari project contributors

napari is a Python library for multi-dimensional image visualisation, annotation, and analysis. 
napari leverages the scientific Python stack and supports bidirectional communication between 
the viewer and the Python kernel. Importantly, it’s an open, community developed project, 
which means that anyone can contribute. There are number of options for contributing to the 
napari community depending on your bandwidth and desired level of engagement—all are very welcome! 
You can join the image.sc forums, our Zulip chat (napari.zulipchat.com), or one of the community 
meetings to engage with the community. You can share Python scripts that use the napari API 
along with other Python modules—these can even add on to the napari GUI thanks to the use of 
widgets. Going beyond that, you can develop a napari plugin, which is Python package published 
on PyPI, that extends napari functionality in a publicly discoverable fashion. Alternately, 
you can contribute to the napari project itself, by tackling open issues to fix bugs or by 
implementing a new feature. Importantly, you can make non-code contributions to the documentation—which 
are extremely valuable—by reviewing, editing, updating, or writing new guides or tutorials. 
All of these contributions combine to make for a supportive, dynamic, and sustainable napari community.
