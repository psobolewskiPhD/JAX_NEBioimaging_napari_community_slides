## What is napari?

a Python library for n-dimensional image visualisation, annotation, and analysis.
![](images/viewer_screenshot.png){fig-alt="screenshot of napari viewer in 3D rendering mode showing 3 layers: 1) image of cell nuclei (green), 2) image of cell membranes (purple), 3) points indicating nuclei (red)" height="500" }

## What can napari be used for?

- view & explore 2D, 3D, and higher-dimensional arrays
- overlay derived data such as points, polygons, labels, and more
- seamlessly weave exploration, computation, and annotation together in imaging data analysis

## napari is an open-source, community developed project—anyone can contribute! {.center}

## What is the napari community?

- napari users: local and global
- napari plugin developers
- napari core developers
- broader scientific Python community

## Ask and answer questions!

- image.sc forum: [https://forum.image.sc/tag/napari](https://forum.image.sc/tag/napari)

- napari Zulip chat: [https://napari.zulipchat.com](https://napari.zulipchat.com/)

## Report bugs—or test existing ones

- GitHub Issues: [https://github.com/napari/napari/issues](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues)

- Reporting bugs/problems/inconstencies/confusion is **extremely valuable!**
- When in doubt, report—we prefer duplicates than crickets!

> # Headless napari is just Python!

### -- Juan Nuñez-Iglesias (**@jni**)


## Share Python scripts & notebooks!
```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "expand for full code"
#| echo: true
from skimage import data
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

import napari

blobs = data.binary_blobs(length=128, volume_fraction=0.1, n_dim=3)
labeled = ndi.label(blobs)[0]
viewer, image_layer = napari.imshow(blobs, name='blobs')
viewer.add_labels(labeled, name='blob ID')
viewer.dims.ndisplay = 3
viewer.camera.zoom = 3
viewer.camera.angles = (3, 38, 53)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    napari.run()
```
```{python}
#| echo: false
from napari.utils import nbscreenshot
nbscreenshot(viewer, alt_text="A rotated 3D view of labled blobs")
```
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| outout: false
viewer.close()
```

## Python scripts can handle keyboard and mouse events!

- Customize napari functionality:
    * keyboard and mouse events: [https://napari.org/stable/howtos/connecting_events.html](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/connecting_events.html)

```python
@viewer.bind_key('a')
def accept_image(viewer):
    msg = 'this is a good image'
    viewer.status = msg
    print(msg)
```

- Example: [https://napari.org/stable/gallery/custom_mouse_functions.html](https://napari.org/stable/gallery/custom_mouse_functions.html#sphx-glr-gallery-custom-mouse-functions-py)

## Python scripts can contribute widgets!

![](images/magic_parameter_screenshot.png){height="450" fig-alt="Screenshot of napari UI with a docked widget on the right for applying scikit-image filters" fig-align="center"}

::: aside
Example: [https://napari.org/stable/gallery/magic_parameter_sweep.html](https://napari.org/stable/gallery/magic_parameter_sweep.html)
:::

## Python scripts can contribute widgets!

- [`magicgui`](https://pyapp-kit.github.io/magicgui/) makes this quite easy, see [https://napari.org/stable/guides/magicgui.html](https://napari.org/stable/guides/magicgui.html)
- ...but you can also use `Qt` for maximal control by subclassing `QWidget`

## How to share Python scripts & notebooks

- email/fileshare with colleagues, collaborators, etc.
- use GitHub:
    * use GitHub Gists: [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/)
    * make a repository of scripts
- with publication (Zenodo, etc.)

## Develop a napari plugin

napari plugins are Python packages that can:

- add file-type readers & writers
- customize functionality
- extend the GUI
- provide demo/sample data

Plugins can be publically discoverable and have global reach via PyPI and [napari-hub.org](https://napari-hub.org)

::: {.notes}
over 350, you can also choose to contribute to existing plugins
:::

## Plugins can be installed from within napari

![](images/napari_plugin_UI.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of napari UI showing the plugin install/uninstall UI" fig-align="center"}

## Contribute to documentation

napari documentation repository: [https://github.com/napari/docs](https://github.com/napari/docs)

Contribution guide: [https://napari.org/dev/developers/documentation/index.html](https://napari.org/dev/developers/documentation/index.html)

- write a how-to, guide, or tutorial
- share a workshop
- help document features/use cases
- copy edit & review

::: aside
Don't forget you can contribute to the documentation of your favorite plugin too!
